# Userland model

Status: decided (2026-09).

## Aegir is not a POSIX system

Aegir exposes its own API — message ports, handlers, devices and libraries in
the Amiga OS lineage — and does not implement a POSIX interface. A POSIX
compatibility layer may be added **later**, as an ordinary user-level service
on top of Aegir's own primitives.

This is why the userspace C library choice (musllibc) is not a POSIX
commitment:

- **`musllibc` is a C standard library, not an OS interface.** We use it for
  `memcpy`, `malloc`, `snprintf`, `qsort`, `<stdint.h>` and the rest of the
  freestanding-embedded reality — writing a general purpose OS without a C
  library would mean writing one first.
- **The POSIX-ish surface lives elsewhere.** In `projects/seL4_libs`, and it is
  optional: `libsel4muslcsys` is described upstream as "a library to support
  muslc for the root task" — it is the shim that satisfies the syscalls musl
  wants, and it is separate from musl itself. Alongside it sit
  `libsel4utils` ("a library OS"), `libsel4simple`, `libsel4vka`,
  `libsel4vspace`, `libsel4allocman` and `libsel4sync`.
- **Therefore:** we can link musl without ever exposing `open`/`read`/`fork`.
  The syscall shim is wired for the calls we choose and stubbed elsewhere.
  Adding POSIX later means filling in those handlers or adding a service — an
  additive change, not a rewrite.

`libsel4utils` is a useful starting point and a reference for capability
bookkeeping, not Aegir's API: Aegir's own interfaces are ours to define.

## Build consequences

- `cmake-tool/base.cmake` does `find_package(musllibc REQUIRED)` and
  `musllibc_set_environment_flags()`, so musllibc must be **present** for the
  standard seL4 build. That is a build-system requirement, not an API
  requirement.
- Whether a given binary links the `muslc` target is a per-target decision.
  Lean components may want to link only `sel4runtime` + `libsel4`.

## Open items

To be confirmed when the first Aegir root task is linked (M4):

- The exact handler-installation API of `libsel4muslcsys`.
- Whether a `sel4runtime`-only binary (no `muslc`) builds cleanly with the
  standard cmake-tool flow — relevant if some servers should avoid libc.
- C++ standard library posture: freestanding C++ (see `specs/build.md`) means no
  `std::` containers or iostreams until we deliberately vendor a standard
  library.
