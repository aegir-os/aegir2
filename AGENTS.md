# Project rules

- No arbitrary and hardcoded limits without explicit permission. Capacity tables should
  grow on demand.
- Any use of `make test` or other long running bash process must use `timeout` so as to
  detect any 'wedged' process.
- Use the git repository for history.
- Decided on specifications belong in the `specs/` folder off the root of the repo.
- Code should be modular - do not create overly large single files. Use proper naming
  and separation of concerns into separate source files.
- All compiler warnings must be fixed. Disabling the warning is not acceptable.
- Commit after every milestone / phase is finished.
- Architecture specific code must be abstracted to ensure we properly support multiple
  architectures (like riscv64, aarch64, x86-64, etc).
- Any third party dependencies will be vendored - we will not commit third party sources
  to this project repo. Pin the dependency (use the SHA hash!) and extract upon demand.
  We can maintain a patches/ folder for any changes needed to the third_party dependency.
